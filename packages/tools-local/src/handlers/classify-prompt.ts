Categories:
- tool_discovery: The developer needs to find, select, or identify a tool, library, framework, or service
- stack_building: The developer needs to compose multiple tools together to build a complete system
- tool_comparison: The developer wants to compare two or more specific tools
- tool_configuration: The developer already has a tool chosen and needs help configuring or using it
- debugging: The developer is encountering an error, bug, or unexpected behavior
- general_coding: Architecture, business logic, algorithms — no new tool selection is needed

Rules:
1. If the prompt involves building something "from scratch" or asks for tech stack recommendations, classify as stack_building
2. If the prompt mentions a specific tool and asks "should I use X or Y", classify as tool_comparison
3. If the prompt is about implementing features WITHOUT mentioning specific tools, classify as tool_discovery
4. If the prompt mentions an error message, traceback, or "not working", classify as debugging
5. Respond with ONLY the category name, nothing else
